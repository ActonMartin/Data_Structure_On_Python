    "Now we want to improve things. Let’s think in terms of binary search. One thing that we can note from the above example is that if we are on integer 3, which squares up to 9, decreasing the integer 3 will not take us anywhere near 12. On the other hand, if we are on integer 4, which squares up to 16, increasing the number will not take us closer to 12. We can make use of this observation and tweak the binary search algorithm to solve our problem efficiently. This observation enables us to reduce our search span.\n",

    "On lines 3-4, low and high are initialized to 0 and k. The while loop on line 6 will terminate when low becomes greater than high. In the next line, we calculate mid as we have always done while implementing the binary search. Additionally, we take the square of mid and store it in mid_squared on line 8. Now we need to compare mid_squared with k. If mid_squared is less than or equal to k, we have to discard all the numbers less than mid. Therefore, we set low equal to mid + 1. On the other hand, if mid_squared is greater than k, then all the numbers greater than mid will not be useful in our search, so we set high equal to mid-1 (line 13). Finally, after the while loop terminates, low - 1 will be the answer we are looking for, i.e., the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to k.\n",
