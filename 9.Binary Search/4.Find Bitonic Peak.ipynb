    "As always in the case of Binary Search, low and high are set to 0 and len(A) - 1 on lines 2-3. On line 6, we have an edge case that checks if the incoming array can be bitonic or not. For an array to be bitonic, it must have at least three elements. Therefore, on line 7, None is returned from the function in case A has less than three elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the while loop, after calculating mid on line 10, the left and right elements to the midpoint are stored in mid_left and mid_right (lines 12-13). Before accessing the left and the right positions to the midpoint, we need to make sure that these positions are within the array. This is done by shorthand in Python. If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line which we have done on lines 12-13. If mid - 1 > 0 is True, mid_left is set to A[mid - 1]. Otherwise, it will set to float(\"-inf\").\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if mid + 1 < len(A) evaluates to True, mid_right is set equal to A[mid + 1], otherwise it is set equal to float(\"inf\"). From line 15 to line 20, we check if A[mid] satisfies the peak property or not as specified in the slides. Based on the conditions discussed in the slides, we discard the left or the right side, but if the elements on both the sides of A[mid] are less than A[mid] i.e., the condition on line 19 evaluates to True, we have found the peak element which is returned from the function on line 20.\n",
