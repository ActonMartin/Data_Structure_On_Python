    "In this lesson, we will be given a sorted array and a target number. Our goal is to find a number in the array that is closest to the target number. We will be making use of a binary search to solve this problem, so make sure that you have gone through the previous lesson.\n",

    "    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9}\n",
    "    Target number = 11\n",
    "    Output : 9\n",

    "    Output : 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now the intuitive approach to solving this problem is to iterate through the array and calculate the difference between each element and the target element. The closest to target will be the element with the least difference. Unfortunately, the running time complexity for this algorithm will increase in proportion to the size of the array. We need to think of a better approach.\n",

    "\n",
    "A is the input array, and target is the element to be searched. min_diff is set to float(\"inf\") on line 6 so that it acts as an upper bound for the minimum difference between target and the other elements. Just as in binary search, low and high are set to 0 and len(A) - 1 respectively (lines 7-8). On line 9, closest_num is initialized to None and we will update it as we move along the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to the crux of the solution, let’s discuss the edge cases we have written from lines 11-16:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Edge cases for empty list of list\n",
    "    # with only one element:\n",
    "    if len(A) == 0:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    if len(A) == 1:\n",
    "        return A[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there is an empty list, i.e., len(A) is equal to 0, None is returned to indicate that there is no element closest to target. If there is only one element in the list, i.e., len(A) is equal to 1, then only that element is returned on line 16 to indicate that it is closest to target as there is no other element for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have a while loop just like we have in Binary Search. Below is a snippet from lines 18-26:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    while low <= high:\n",
    "        mid = (low + high)//2\n",
    " \n",
    "        # Ensure you do not read beyond the bounds\n",
    "        # of the list.\n",
    "        if mid+1 < len(A):\n",
    "            min_diff_right = abs(A[mid + 1] - target)\n",
    "        if mid > 0:\n",
    "            min_diff_left = abs(A[mid - 1] - target)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate mid in the same way we do in Binary Search. Then, we have to calculate the difference between target and the elements to the left and the right of mid. To ensure we don’t go out of bounds of the list, we check if mid+1 is less than the length of A, only then we access the element on the position mid+1 on line 24 to calculate the difference. On line 24, we take the absolute of the difference between A[mid+1] and target and store it in min_diff_right. Similarly, we ensure that we don’t go out of bounds of the array on the left side and check if mid is greater than 0 on line 25. If it is, min_diff_left is calculated by taking the absolute of the difference of target and A[mid-1] on line 26.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we are done calculating the difference between target and the elements to the left and right of the midpoint, we’ll figure out which is the closest to target by comparing the differences. The code below is from lines 28-37 which compares min_diff_left and min_diff_right to min_diff and updates the min_diff accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if the absolute value between left\n",
    "        # and right elements are smaller than any\n",
    "        # seen prior.\n",
    "        if min_diff_left < min_diff:\n",
    "            min_diff = min_diff_left\n",
    "            closest_num = A[mid - 1]\n",
    " \n",
    "        if min_diff_right < min_diff:\n",
    "            min_diff = min_diff_right\n",
    "            closest_num = A[mid + 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "If min_diff_left < min_diff is True, closest_num is set to A[mid - 1] on line 33. Otherwise, if min_diff_right < min_diff evaluates to True, on line 37, closest_num updates to A[mid + 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s discuss the code from lines 39-49:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        # Move the mid-point appropriately as is done\n",
    "        # via binary search.\n",
    "        if A[mid] < target:\n",
    "            low = mid + 1\n",
    "        elif A[mid] > target:\n",
    "            high = mid - 1\n",
    "        # If the element itself is the target, the closest\n",
    "        # number to it is itself. Return the number.\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return A[mid]\n",
    "    return closest_num\n",
    "```\n",
    "The next midpoint is updated in a similar way as in Binary Search. However, here we need to cater to an additional case in which the midpoint itself is the target element. For such a case, we return the midpoint, i.e., A[mid] on line 48. The while loop will keep iterating and dividing the array in case low is less than high to find the closest number to target. When the loop terminates, we return closest_num on line 49.\n",
    "\n",
    "That ends the discussion for this problem. In the next lesson, we will look at a different problem and analyze how it is solved using a binary search. See you there!"
