    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "The naive approach to solving this problem is pretty simple. You iterate through the list and check if each element matches its index. If you find a match, you return that element. Otherwise, you return None if you don’t find a match by the end of the for loop. Have a look at the code below:\n",

    "As the entire list is traversed once to find the fixed point, spending constant time on each element, the time complexity for the linear implementation above is O(n)O(n). As we haven’t used any additional space in the implementation above, the space complexity is O(1)O(1). Now we need to think about how we can improve the solution above.

    "On lines 4-5, we define low and high in the same way we have always defined them for Binary Search. The next few lines (lines 7-8) are also the same as the code in a binary search. On line 10, we check if A[mid] is less than mid to decide which portion of the array to discard in further search. If the condition on line 10 evaluates to True, execution jumps to line 11 where low is set to mid+1 to discard the portion to the left of mid. However, if the condition on line 10 evaluates to False, the condition on line 12 is evaluated. If A[mid] is greater than mid, i.e., high is set to mid-1 to disregard the portion to the right of the midpoint. If both the conditions on line 10 and line 11 are False, it implies that A[mid] is equal to mid. We have found a fixed point! In this case, A[mid] is returned from the function on line 15. To cater to the case if there is no fixed point in the array, we return None on line 16 after the while loop terminates.\n",
