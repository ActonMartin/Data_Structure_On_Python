If self.head is None, then the condition on line 2 will evaluate to true and we will initialize self.head to a new Node based on the input parameter data. As this is the append method for a circular linked list, we make the next of the head point to itself on line 4.\n",

In this case, we iterate the linked list to get to the last element whose next is the head node and insert the new element after that last node. On line 6, we initialize new_node by calling the constructor of the Node class and passing data to it. Next, we have to find an appropriate position in the linked list to insert new_node. For this, we set cur to self.head on line 7 and set up a while loop on line 8 which executes until the next node of the cur does not equal self.head. cur is updated to cur.next in the body of the while loop on line 9 to help us traverse the linked list. After the while loop terminates, cur will be the node that points to the head node and we will insert new_node after cur. Hence, we set cur.next equal to new_node on line 10. As we have to complete our circular chain, we set new_node.next to point to self.head on line 11. This completes our implementation for the append method."
