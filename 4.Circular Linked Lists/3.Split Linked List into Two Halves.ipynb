Using the while loop, we traverse through the linked list until count becomes equal to mid or cur becomes None. After prev becomes equal to cur, cur becomes cur.next in the while loop (lines 17-18). Also, we increment count on line 16 so that we only traverse up to the midpoint. When count becomes equal to or greater than mid, we reach the midpoint from where we have to split. To complete the splitting for the first linked list, we set prev.next (next of the last node in the first linked list) to self.head on line 2 to make the first list linked circular. At this point, we are done with our first linked list, and the first node of the second linked list is held in variable cur.

Finally when we reach the end of the original linked list as cur.next equals self.head, we terminate the while loop and append the data of cur to split_cclist on line 25.
