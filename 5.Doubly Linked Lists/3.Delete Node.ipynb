Now at this point, we have met most of the conditions for Case 1, and we have to do a final check. Therefore, on line 6, we check if the next node of cur is None or not. This will confirm if it’s the only node in the linked list. If it is the only node in the linked list, then cur has met the criteria for the type of node mentioned in Case 1.

As explained before, the condition on line 6 checks if cur is the only node in the linked list which is a criterion for Case 1. If cur.next is not None, it implies that cur is not the only node in the linked list and the execution jumps to the else part (line 12). On line 13, we save the next node of cur in a variable named nxt. Now cur needs to be deleted, so we set cur.next to None on line 14. After the deletion, nxt will be the new head as we are deleting the current head. Therefore, we set nxt.prev to None (line 15) instead of cur, which is set to None in the next line. Finally, we make nxt the head node by setting self.head to nxt on line 17 and return from the method in the very next line. In the code above, we have successfully deleted the head node and made the next node of the deleted head node the new head node."

If cur is the head node, execution jumps to line 6 but if it’s not the head node, execution jumps to line 22. Here, we check whether cur is the last node in the linked list or not. If it is not, then cur perfectly matches the description for Case 3. From line 23 onwards comes the deletion part where we remove cur and make the previous node of cur point to the next node of cur and vice versa. We save the next and the previous nodes of cur in the variables nxt and prev (lines 23-24). To remove cur in-between prev and next, we set prev.next to nxt (line 25) which was previously set to cur, and nxt.prev updates to prev from cur on line 26.
