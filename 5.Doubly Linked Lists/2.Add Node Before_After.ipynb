If true, then we call the prepend method that we implemented in the last lesson which will do the necessary steps to insert the new node before the head node, after which we return (lines 5-6). However, if we don’t want to insert before the head node and find the node that we want to insert before (which is not the head node), the execution jumps to line 8. The first thing we do is create the new_node by passing in data to the constructor from the Node class. On line 9, we store the previous node of the current node in a temporary variable prev. Now we need to update all the pointers to make the insertion successful. So, on line 10, we update the next node of prev to be new_node and as we have to insert new_node before cur, we set cur.prev to new_node on line 11. Let’s also update the previous and the next pointers of new_node. As new_node is before cur, the next of new_node points to cur (line 12) and as prev is the previous node to new_node now, new_node.prev points to prev on line 13.
