    "his brute force solution is an intuitive approach. We set max_profit equal to 0 on line 5. The for loop on line 6 iterates over every element in A. Now for every element of A, we iterate over all the elements in A which are at a greater position than that element in A using the for loop on line 7. In this way, we calculate all possible profits by selling with all possible prices after we buy the stocks. Now if the calculated profit, i.e., A[j] - A[i] is greater than the max_profit, we update max_profit to its new greater value on line 9. Finally, we return max_profit on line 10 which will be the maximum possible profit that we got by buying stocks on each day and selling them on all possible days after the day we buy them. Therefore, this solution has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ as we generate all the possible buying and selling combinations using nested for loops. Now we need to think of a better solution. Let’s check out Solution 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution 2: Tracking Min Price ##\n",
    "In solution 2, for each index, we calculate the most profit we can make by selling at that time. So, for a given day, the maximum profit can be made if the stock were bought at the minimum price on an earlier day. Therefore, we maintain the minimum price seen so far and subtract it from every future price to keep track of the maximum profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate the array once and keep track of the minimum buying price and the maximum profit. We calculate the profit at each iteration by subtracting the minimum buying price seen so far from the current price in each iteration and updating the maximum profit accordingly.\n",

As we are supposed to keep track of the minimum price, we update min_price using the min function on line 9 where min_price is the minimum amount between min_price and price of the current iteration. In the next line, we store the calculated profit (price - min_price) in compare_profit.
