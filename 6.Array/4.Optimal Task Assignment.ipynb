    "Yes, the implementation was that simple! After sorting the array using sorted on line 3, the for loop on line 5 iterates for half the length of the array and prints out the pairs using indexing. So ~i on line 6 is the bitwise complement operator which puts a negative sign in front of i. Thus, the negative numbers as indexes mean that you count from the right of the array instead of the left. So, A[-1] refers to the last element, A[-2] is the second-last, and so on. In this way, we are able to pair the numbers from the beginning of the array to the end of the array.\n",
