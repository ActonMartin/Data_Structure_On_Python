    "n this lesson, we will be considering how to solve the problem of implementing a function that converts a spreadsheet column ID (i.e., “A”, “B”, “C”, …, “Z”, “AA”, etc.) to the corresponding integer. For example, “A” equals 1 because it represents the first column, while “AA” equals 27 because it represents the 27th column.\n",

    "From the illustration above, you can easily deduce the general formula. We start from the left-most digit and multiply it with the base raised to the power of (n-1)(n−1) where nn is the number of digits in that number. We continue with the same procedure with the other digits but keep subtracting one from the power of the base, so the power of the base will be 0 for the last digit. Finally, the sum of all the products is equivalent to the original number.\n",

    "num is set to 0 initially on line 2 and returned from the function on line 7. count is initialized to len(col_str) - 1 where col_str is the string representing the columnID that we have to convert into a number. count will help us in determining the power of the base as we convert the columnID into a corresponding integer. On line 4, s will represent each character of col_str in each iteration of the for loop. Let’s jump to line 5 where 26 (base) is raised to the power of count where count is len(col_str) - 1 as indicated in the formula. The result from the power operation (**) is multiplied with the equivalent of s in base 26 system which we find using the ord function. The final answer as a result of these calculations is added to the value of the existing num on line 5. On line 6, count is decremented by 1 as the power of the base decreases by 1 for the digits from left to the right. After the calculations have been done for every character in s, the for loop terminates, and the value of num is returned from the function.\n",
