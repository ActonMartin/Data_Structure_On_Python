On line 5, in the outer while loop, count is set to 1 before the execution proceeds to the inner while loop. The inner while loop on line 6 runs until the value of i does not exceed the length of s and the current and next character of s indicated by i are the same. So essentially, in the inner while loop, we are keeping a count of consecutive similar characters as we increment i and count by 1 in each iteration of the inner while loop (lines 7-8).\n",

On line 9, count is converted to a string and s[i], which is the number we have the count for, is concatenated and appended to result. i is incremented on line 10 to iterate to the next character in the next iteration of the outer while loop where count resets to 1 once again to count for the next number.\n",
