    "# Explanation #\n",
    "We create a method, swap_nodes, in the code above, which takes key_1 and key_2 as input parameters. First of all, we check if key_1 and key_2 are the same element (line 3). If they are, we return from the method on line 4. On line 6 and line 7, we declare prev_1 and curr_1 to None and self.head respectively. We loop through the linked list using the while loop on line 8 which runs while curr_1 is not at the end of the linked list or it is not equal to the key_1 that we seek. In the while loop, we keep updating the prev_1 node equal to the curr_1 and the curr_1 to the next node in the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, we try to find if key_2 exists in the linked list or not. We set prev_2 equal to None while we set curr_2 equal to the head of the linked list. Then again while the curr_2 is not None and the curr_2.data is not equal to key_2, we update the prev_2 and curr_2 nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "On lines 18-19, we check to make sure that the elements we found, i.e.,curr_1 and curr_2 actually exist or not. If either of the conditions, not curr_1 or not curr_2, are not true (curr_1 or curr_2 is None) then one of them doesn’t exist in the linked list. If neither key exists in the linked list or if only one of the keys exists in the linked list, we can’t swap, so we return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the two cases that we specified while discussing the algorithm. Let’s consider the case where either curr_1 or curr_2 is the head node. If both of the current nodes have a previous node, it implies that neither is a head node. So, we will check if the previous nodes of the current nodes exist or not. If they don’t exist and are None, then the node without the previous node is the head node.\n",
    "\n",
    "On line 21, we check if prev_1 exists or not. If it exists, we set the next of prev_1 to curr_2 to swap it. Previously, prev1.next was pointing to curr_1 but on line 22, we set it to point to curr_2. On the other hand, if prev1 does not exist, it implies that curr_1 is the head node and we set self.head to its new value, i.e., curr_2 on line 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat the same steps as above on lines 26-29 for prev_2 and curr_2 and update the relevant positions with curr_1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have handled the previous nodes that will point to the different nodes, we’ll swap the next of curr_1 with the next of the curr_2 and vice versa. On line 31, we code this swap using the Python shorthand."
