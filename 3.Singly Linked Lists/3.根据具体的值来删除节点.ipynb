This will keep track of the previous node of the node to be deleted. On the next line (line 11), we have a while loop which will run until cur_node becomes None. This implies that key doesn’t exist in our linked list. Another occurrence that would stop the loop would be the cur_node.data equaling key which refers to the case where we have found the node to be deleted. In the while loop, we set prev to cur_node on line 12 to keep track of the previous node while cur_node is updated to the next node in the next line.\n",

    "When the while loop terminates, we check using an if-condition on line 15 whether or not it’s because of cur_node being None, which will imply that key did not match any of the data of the current node. If it’s true, then we return from the method as there is no node to delete. However, if cur_node is not None and its data matches with the key, we proceed to line 18. As we kept track of the previous node of the node to be deleted (prev), we now want to point it to the next node of the node to be deleted instead of pointing it to the node that we want to delete (cur_node). Therefore, we set prev.next to cur_node.next. In this way, we have removed the link of the cur.node that was previously in between. Finally, we set the node to be deleted (cur_node) equal to None on line 19.\n"
