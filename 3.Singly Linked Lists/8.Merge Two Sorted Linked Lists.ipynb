Once s points to the smaller value of the data of nodes that p and q point to, p or q will move on to the next node in their respective linked list. If s and p point to the same node, p moves forward; otherwise q moves forward. The final merged linked list will be made from the nodes that s keeps pointing to.

    "We pass llist which is the second linked list that we are going to merge with the linked list on which the class method merge_sorted is called. As discussed in the algorithm, p and q will initially point to the heads of each of the two linked lists (lines 3-4). On line 5, we declare s and assign None to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "On lines 7-10, we handle the case if one of the linked lists is empty. If not p evaluates to true, it means that the first linked list is empty; therefore, we return q on line 8. Similarly, we check for the second linked list by using q which points to the head of the second linked list (llist). If it’s empty, then we return p.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll code the main idea of our algorithm. On line 12, we will proceed if both p and q are not None. If p and q are not None, then we compare the data of the nodes they are pointing to. If p.data is less than q.data, then s will point to p (line 14). On the other hand, if q.data is less than p.data, s will point to q (line 17). Also, as shown in the algorithm, p and q will move along if s points to the node they were previously pointing to. Therefore, based on whichever condition is true, we update p and q accordingly by pointing it to s.next (line 15 and line 18). Now you can note that the node with the lesser value of p and q will be the first node of our merged linked list. Therefore, we set it as the new_head on line 19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go ahead and break down the code in the following while loop (lines 20-28):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while p and q:\n",
    "      if p.data <= q.data:\n",
    "          s.next = p \n",
    "          s = p \n",

    "          s = q\n",
    "          q = s.next\n",
    "```\n",
    "The while loop will run until either p or q becomes None. Again, we’ll execute the corresponding block of code based on the condition in the if-statement. If p.data is less than or equal to q.data, then we want to point s to what p is pointing to and move p along its respective linked list. Therefore, we save what p is pointing to by assigning it to s.next (line 22). On line 23, we update the value of s to p because p.data is less than or equal to q.data. Now we make p move along by pointing it to the next node of s (line 24).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines 26-28 are the mirror image of lines 22-34 except that they will be executed if q.data is less than p.data. Also, they’ll make s point to whatever q was pointing to and will make q move along its linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s discuss the following portion of the code (lines 29-33):\n",
    "```\n",
    "  if not p:\n",
    "      s.next = q \n",
    "  if not q:\n",
    "      s.next = p \n",
    "  return new_head\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code will reach this point after the while loop terminates which implies either p or q or both p and q have become None. We check using the conditions on line 29 and line 31 that we have reached the None for which of the linked lists. If we have reached the end of p, i.e., the condition on line 29 becomes true, we make the next of s point to q. This means that s will now point to the remaining llist. This will complete the entire chain of our merged linked list. In the same way, we check if q has reached the end of the linked list or not and update s.next accordingly (line 32).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, on line 33, we return new_head from the method which is the head node of our merged linked list made from llist and the linked list on which this class method is called.\n"
