Now think if we are given an array and a value to insert at the beginning of an array. For insertion, we have to shift all the elements in the array to the right. The shifting makes room for the element at the beginning of the array. Due to the shifting of the elements, the time complexity is O(n)O(n). The same is the case with the deletion of an element from the beginning of an array. Again, we shift all the elements back by one index.
